Given the names and grades for each student in a class of N students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.
Note: If there are multiple students with the second lowest grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.




if __name__ == '__main__':
    x=[]
    y=[]
    h=0
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        name = input()
        score = float(input())
        
        x.append([name, score])
  
f = sorted (list(set([r[1] for r in x])))
sec= f[1]
low=[]

for i in x:
    if  i[1] == sec:
        low.append(i)    
low= sorted(low)
#print(low[0][1])  
nnn= len(low)    

for i in range(nnn):
    print(low[i][0])
